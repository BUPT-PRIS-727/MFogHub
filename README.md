Fig1: Overview of MFogHub. Right: MFogHub collects data from 15 marine fog-prone regions worldwide, captured by 6 geostationary satellites. Middle: Data for each region-satellite pair is organized in a cube-stream structure with dimensions of “timestamp-spectral band-latitude-longitude.” MFogHub includes 21 cube-streams in total, each with corresponding masks, supporting both detection and forecasting tasks. Left: MFogHub enables unique evaluations of model generalization across multiple regions and satellite.

## Introduction

We introduce the MFogHub dataset—the first multi-regional, multi-satellite dataset for global marine fog detection and forecasting. MFogHub contains over 68,000 samples, and spans 15 coastal fog-prone regions, consolidating 693 marine fog events. The dataset captures multi-band meteorological data from 6 geostationary satellites. The minimum time interval is 30 minutes, with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a size of 1024 × 1024 pixels. Additionally, more than 11,600 samples are meticulously annotated at the pixel level by meteorological experts.

## How to use

Due to repository size limitations and the requirements for anonymous submission, we provide a smaller version of the MFogHub dataset to showcase our examples shown as Folder `small_version`. The data is organized according to the tasks of marine fog detection or forecasting. Each data sample is named in the format `"SatelliteAbbreviation_RegionAbbreviation_Timestamp.npy"`, and its corresponding label is named `"SatelliteAbbreviation_RegionAbbreviation_Timestamp.png"`.

## How to create new samples

We provide the complete processing workflow from raw satellite radiometer data to images. The corresponding processing code, along with visualization examples of true-color and pseudo-color images, can be found in the `process` folder. The workflow supports generating customized multi-channel images with specific latitude-longitude ranges and spatial resolutions.
